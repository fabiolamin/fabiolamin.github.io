									<h1>About me</h1>
								</header>
									<p>Hello, my name is Fábio Lamin and I'm a Unity Developer with several relesead projects.</p>
									<p>I always had a curiosity to know how a game is created, so when I was a kid, I started to create some simple 2D games in Game Maker. This was my first experience with game development and was awesome! At the first year of college, there a class about game development which teach the students how to create a game using Construct 2 as game engine. From that moment, my game development journey started! As that moment, the C# was the programming language that I most used in college, so I started to use Unity to create some games.</p>
									<p>I love to create games, especially in the programming side. I really like to solve problems, build mechanics and write code in general. Another thing that I like too is do game jams with my friends, I think the communication is a key skill in game development, and the game jams can provide this and other knowledges like teamwork, problems solving and deadlines. Also, I’m always doing personal projects that have been improving my programming knowledges.</p>
